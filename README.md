# Chess
Just a demo project I made for fun. Using Ruby, creates a GUI with a chessboard and pieces. The board tracks whose turn it is, and how pieces can move and capture.

# How to use
1. Install Ruby
2. Install Ruby gems
3. Install bundler `gem install bundler`
4. Run `bundle install`
5. Run the program by calling `ruby lib/main.rb`
